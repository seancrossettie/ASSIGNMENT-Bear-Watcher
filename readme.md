## Overview
This app allows the user to track the eating habits of bears in during their fishing season. The user can add bears and log each time a bear attempts to catch or catches a fish. This was an assignment used to learn Javascript modules.
## User Story
The user is prompted with a form to input a new bear name and image url, which then is printed by a function to the DOM as a card, displaying the image and name of the bear with a short caption. The card contains two buttons, one to track how many fish are caught and how many attempts to catch a fish were made. Upon clicking each, a date stamp is printed to log the last fishing event.
